Note: needs a lot more convergence than normal.

Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex
Interlacing: Bob tff
Internal resolution: use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.
Note: menus are convergence dependant, but not to an unplayable amount.
Note 2: water and crystal refraction needs a manual fix.

Dark Cloud
Interlacing: Bob tff
Internal resolution: use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.
Note: one wave effect in the distance needs to be disabled or not stereoized (regex 3). Needs manual fix.

Dark Cloud 2
Note: one wave effect in the distance needs to be disabled or not stereoized (regex 3). Needs manual fix.
Note 2: some geometry elements (not as many as Dragon Quest VIII) have clipping. Use low separation if it annoys you.

Devil May Cry
Disable regex 3.
Interlacing: Bob tff
Internal resolution: use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.

Disable regex 3.
Note: for perfect shadows, they need to not be stereoized in regex 2. Needs manual fix.

Dragon Quest V
Disable regex 2 and 3.

Disable regex 3.
Note: geometry like characters and other elements have a lot of clipping. You need to use low separation.
Note 2: water refraction needs a manual fix in shader regex 1.

Final Fantasy X
Note: battle background blurring has haloing that needs a shaderoverride for regex 3.

Final Fantasy XII
Note: some background blurring has haloing that needs a shaderoverride for regex 1.
Note 2: needs some small fixes here and there. Nothing too important.

God of War
Note: needs special convergence/separation presets with "g" key.

God of War 2
Note: needs special convergence/separation presets with "g" key.

Jak & Daxter
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Interlacing (if you don't use progressive scan): Bob tff
Internal resolution (if you don't use progressive scan): use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.
Note: menus are convergence dependant, but not to an unplayable amount.
Note 2: it needs shaderoverrides for the blur filter (regex 3) and shadows (regex 1).

Kingdom Hearts
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Note: regex 2 is partially needed for some effects, but will break shadows. Needs manual fix.

Kingdom Hearts 2
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Note: regex 2 is partially needed for some effects, but will break shadows. Needs manual fix.

Marvel vs. Capcom 2
Interlacing: Bob bff
Note: pause menu can only be seen of regex 1 (geometry) is not 3D. A workaround is using dominant eye view.

Metal Gear Solid 2
Disable regex 2 and 3.

Metal Gear Solid 3
Disable regex 2 and 3.

Okami
Disable regex 3.

Persona 4
Note: character shadows pixel shaders needs to not be stereoized in regex 1. Needs manual fix.
Note 2: ghosting is only perfect at 63.5 convergence. It needs to be not stereoized in regex 1, or disabled.
Note 3: convergence dependant HUD, but not too annoying.
Note 4: the game switches between two convergence levels every few seconds. It looks like it's changing the z buffer.

Ratchet & Clank
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Mipmapping: Basic
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: skybox is at screen depth. Needs manual fix in regex 1.

Ratchet & Clank 2
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Mipmapping: Basic
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: skybox is at screen depth. Needs manual fix in regex 1.

Disable regex 2 and 3.
Mipmapping: Basic or Automatic
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: skybox is at screen depth. Needs manual fix in regex 1.

Ratchet Deadlocked
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Mipmapping: Basic or Automatic
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: skybox is at screen depth. Needs manual fix in regex 1.

Rogue Galaxy
Disable regex 3.
Note: geometry like characters and other elements have a lot of clipping. You need to use low separation.
Note 2: some smoke effects from regex 3 need to be stereoized. Needs manual fix.

Disable regex 2 and 3.
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)

Saint Seiya The Hades
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: one small effect (when dodging) needs to be stereoized in regex 2. Needs manual fix.

Shadow of the Colossus
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: flickering caused by bloom and motion blur.

Silent Hill 2
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Note: some shadows need manual fix. Some may be unfixable, but not too bad.

Super Dragon Ball Z
Disable regex 3.
Note: some HUD text is convergence dependant in regex 1. Needs manual fix.
Note 2: it needs lower than average convergence levels to be normal.

Soul Calibur III
Disable regex 3.
Align Sprite
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: regex 2 fixes part of the HUD, but regex 1 needs a manual fix for the text. Also, the character
select screen is convergence dependant. Using left or right eye views can be a workaround for these issues.

Star Ocean 3
Disable regex 2 and 3.
Interlacing (if you don't use progressive scan): Bob tff
Internal resolution (if you don't use progressive scan): use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.
Note: menus are convergence dependant. They need a manual fix.
Note 2: disabling regex 2 fixes some HUD things, but makes some small shadows 2D.

Tales of the Abyss
Half-pixel Offset: Special (Texture - aggressive)
Note: bloom effect needs to not be stereoized, or disabled. When stereoized, it's OK at 63.5 convergence.
Note 2: the HUD (regex 1 and 2) is convergence dependant.

Tekken 5
Disable regex 2.
Interlacing (PAL version): Bob tff
Internal resolution (PAL version): use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.
Align sprite.
Note: doing the resolution tweak (I assume custom resolution and interlacing aren't needed in the
USA/JP versions because they have progressive scan) will make the Align Sprite hack not work. It needs
manual render target stereoization for the native resolution multipliers.
Note 2: shadows need a manual fix in regex 1.
Note 3: main menu HUD is affected by convergence in regex 1, so it needs a manual fix or using dominant eye view.

Ys IV
Interlacing: Bob tff
Internal resolution: use a custom resolution with very high vertical resolution, at least
almost double of what corresponds to a 16:9 resolution. The game won't be 3D otherwise.
Note: the HUD needs dominant eye.

Ys V
Interlacing: Bob tff
Note: most of the HUD needs to be unstereoized.
